Nickerson,yes,yes,Works for pups too!,"My dog has developed quite a fear of fireworks and thunderstorms so I decided to try these before turning to medications for him. The first time I put them on him he resisted but I didn’t want to give up. The first time there were fireworks going off I put them on him and he quickly settled down. Now when he hears that first boom he comes to me to have them put on. He can still hear them but it is dramatically better.

"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 17, 2022",AlejandraAlejandra,yes,yes,Most bad reviews aren't using them correctly!,"I really needed some noise cancelling earmuffs for my baby, my kids love going to the movies and I hated that I couldn't take them because it was way too loud for my newborn, I did a ton of research and I finally ended getting these and am I happy I did, they are super easy to adjust and to put on the baby and they are very comfortable, the earmuffs are very soft and they won't press on the baby's ears so my baby will leave them on even though he doesn't understand why I'm putting them on him, he can very easily lay on my arms and the earmuffs will not be in the way ay all, the strap is wide and very stretchy, I really appreciate that it comes with 2 straps and that each strap has 3 velcros so you can adjust it to the baby's head, now I see a ton of comments or reviews of people complaining that the strap will keep falling and covering the baby's eyes!! That is because they are putting the strap on the wrong way!! The strap has a non slip strip so that it doesn't slip on to the baby's eyes!!!! The velcro part goes to the back of the babies head not the front like you can see in most of the reviews that people do, if you put it on the right way there is no way of the strap moving from its place, one last thing is that the earmuffs also come with a travel bag that I love because I can take them anywhere without having to worry about losing them or possibly getting them damaged, I can just put the bag in my diaper bag or purse and take them with me just in case I need them. These are definitely worth every penny, there are a lot more that are way cheaper buy the quality is horrible compared to these, I would definitely spend a little more but get something that I know will actually protect my baby's ears and that will also be very comfortable for him.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719e2STLwlL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71l+7IxWs4L.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WQOU92EI8Z34/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3DRSQZJ,B07KCKWGSG,Color: Black

"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 29, 2022",Debora EspinosaDebora Espinosa,yes,yes,READ!!!! The Velcro goes in the BACK!!!,The media could not be loaded.                  Let me start off by saying majority of these reviews are putting the product on incorrectly. There is a nonslip part and that is the front that goes on the baby’s forehead and the Velcro goes in the back of the baby’s head… I was concerned about buying this product bc of so many reviews saying the band slips down… they aren’t putting the earmuffs on correctly…my baby is 2 weeks old about 7lbs 19in this fits her tiny head a little on the looser side but the nonslip grip keeps the band off her eyes. Music is what my husband and I do. He’s a drummer and I was desperate and worried to find something to protect her ears. Luckily I risked it based on one review saying ppl were putting it on incorrectly. This product has been awesome! Eases my anxiety about damaging her delicate ears. I do recommend putting the strap diagonally it helps secure the strap better on baby’s head( I attached a picture)Also she sleeps through all sessions so clearly it isn’t uncomfortable for her. MAYBE if your baby has a hairy forehead then it may slip a bit but that isn’t the case for us. These are absolutely awesome hope this helps!!,5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610PxZvpH1L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Xy7Vq4NGL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KQDP3NS80265/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B3DRSQZJ,B072HCP5PL,Color: Pink

The headband kept sliding down into her eyes. I tried adjusting it many times and my husband and I even tried holding them in place together on her head but the second we moved our hands to let go--the elastic band slid right back down onto her eyes! I'm disappointed because the quality of the actual ear protection foam is far superior to the other headband-style ear protection we ended up getting her.

"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 2, 2018",Crystal ,yes,yes,Don’t stay on well.,"Three stars, because they do work really well, if you can get them to stay on. I’m sure these would be comfy and effective for a small baby who doesn’t have the motor skills to take them off or mess with them, but it’s hard to justify the price when you’ll probably need a different style in a few months. My little one is 8 months, and these slide around really easily, because she’s so wiggly. It’s hard to even fit them on her in the first place, because the band doesn’t stay in place well. It falls down in front of her eyes, like a blindfold. Needless to say, she’s not a fan of them.

I have small ears and was able to get them over my ears and i could still hear things though percussive sounds were greatly reduced.

We did it in reverse first with the Velcro side facing up closing on the forehead, and it constantly slid down to the baby’s eyes. Then we used the middle of the strap on the forehead closing Velcro on the back, and it worked since there’s a silicon tape under the strap that creates friction so the band won’t slide. The configuration of the strap is like /OO\ so you have to follow that on the weirdly marked X holes on the caps. So on the right cap, put the strap as / going up and on the left cap put it as \ going down direction. Basically you want both caps to face up.

I don’t often review products, but had to say that this one is an absolute lifesaver. We used it for my 6 month old grandson at a weekend wedding. I forgot to bring them to the rehearsal dinner, which was fairly low-key, but still too overwhelming for him. He was a cranky mess and screaming the entire time. The next day at the wedding, I was very nervous about how he was going to do given his behavior at the rehearsal dinner. Luckily, I remembered these headphones and put them on him. He was truly delightful the whole night. He loved being held and dancing on the dance floor, and did really well at cocktail hour, which was full of noise and stimulation. He wore them without issue or trying to take them off. They look very comfortable.

Strap length and tightness can be adjusted based on baby age/size. Our baby found them comfortable and actually fell asleep deeply soon after putting them on. There were a lot of loud noises going on around, bumps, bangs, conversation, traffic noise from outside, dogs, vacuum cleaner and tv, however none of these things seemed to bother the baby’s slumber. It should be noted that these would not work for a baby sleeping on it’s side due to the plastic ear pieces.
